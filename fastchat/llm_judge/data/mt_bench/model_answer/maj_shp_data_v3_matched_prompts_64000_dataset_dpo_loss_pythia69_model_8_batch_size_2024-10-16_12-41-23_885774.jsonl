For example, if you're asked to estimate the probability of a candidate winning the election, you might think that the probability of a candidate winning the election is equal to the base rate of the candidate winning the election. However, the base rate of the candidate winning the election is not equal to the probability of the candidate winning the election. The base rate of the candidate winning the election is the base rate of the candidate winning the election, and the probability of the candidate winning the election is the probability of the candidate winning the", "The first example is a good example of a base rate fallacy. The base rate of the candidate winning the election is the base rate of the candidate winning the election, and the probability of the candidate winning the election is the probability of the candidate winning the election. The base rate of the candidate winning the election is the base rate of the candidate winning the election, and the probability of the candidate winning the election is the probability of the candidate winning the election.
