A binary tree is a tree in which each node has exactly two children. For example, the following binary tree:\n\nA:\n\nThe highest common ancestor of two nodes is the node that has the most common ancestor with both of them.  In this case, the highest common ancestor is the node with the two children, A and B.  So the function you want is:\n\nfunction findHighestCommonAncestor(node1, node2) {\n  if (node1 == null || node2 == null) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  if (node1.left == null && node1.right == null) {\n    return node1;\n  }\n  if (node2.left == null && node2.right == null) {\n    return node2;\n  }\n  return findHighestCommonAncestor(node1.left, node2.left)\n   .then(node1.right)\n   .then(findHighestCommonAncestor(node1.right, node2.right));\n}\n\nYou can test it out here: https://repl.it/repls/CuteAndSmart\n\nA:\n\nI think the most straightforward way to do this is to use a recursive function.
